/**
 * The Robot class represents a robot on a 2D tabletop grid that can be placed, moved, and rotated
 * based on commands. The robot's position is tracked as an (x, y) coordinate pair, and its
 * direction is tracked as one of four cardinal directions (north, east, south or west). The grid is
 * defined by two boundaries, an x boundary and a y boundary, and the robot cannot move or be placed
 * outside these bounds. The robot can report its current position and direction.
